  d3-vis creates a rectangular SVG workspace within which other
  d3 directives may create content. 

  It follows the conventions established
  at http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563. The origin is translated to the
  top left of the inner rectangle.

  fullWidth and fullHeight established the preferred width and height
  of the full space under SVG control.

  If responsive is true, the SVG area will scale down if there is
  insufficient width. The aspect ratio defined by fullWidth and fullHeight
  is preserved.

  woff (width offset), defines an amount that must be subtracted from the 
  actual page width to calculate the amount that is actually available for
  the SVG. It is only used in responsive mode.

  If visible is false or absent, the SVG space has no visibile presence.
  If visible is true, the inner rectangle appears dotted, padded inside a
  solid outer rectangle, which itself has an SVG writable margin surround.

  margin and padding define these surrounds as a space or comma separated
  list of numbers in top, right, bottom, left order.

  The origin appears at the top left of the inner rectangle. Positive axis
  directions are right and down, but these may be transformed by d3 or SVG.

  The margin is a good place to draw axis labels.

    d3-dot-grid draws a rectangular grid of dots.
    along is the preferred number of columns along
    down is the preferred number of rows down
    hspace is the preferred horizontal space between dot centres
      Set to "auto" to calculate this from available width and column count.
      Set to a number otherwise.
      The default is 10.
    vspace is the preferred vertical space between dot centres.
      Set to "auto" to calculate this from available height and row count.
      Set to a number otherwise.
      The default is 10.
    minspace is the minimum space allowed between dot centres
    If square is true and vspace and hspace are 'auto' then they
      are receive equal vertical and horizontal spacing.
