<h1>Boomerangs</h1>

<p>Phil and Cath make and sell boomerangs for a school event.               
	The money they raise will go to charity.</p>

<p>They plan to make them in two sizes: small and large.</p> 

<p>Phil will carve them from wood.
	The small boomerang takes 2 hours to carve and the large one takes 3 
	hours to carve.             
	Phil has a total of 24 hours available for carving.</p>

<p>Cath will decorate them. 
	She only has time to decorate 10 boomerangs of either size.</p>

<p>The small boomerang will make $8 for charity. 
	The large boomerang will make $10 for charity.
	They want to make as much money for charity as they can. </p>

<p>How many small and large boomerangs should they make?</p>

<p>How much money will they then make?</p>
